The given code is from the IV-RL repository: https://github.com/montrealrobotics/iv_rl

I adapted the function calls from the different files and folders since I had problems running them. I also added the max_steps parameter, which represents the number of steps per episode.

I run the DQN and IV-DQN algorithms on the discrete action space environments Acrobot, Cart Pole, Lunar Lander, and Mountain Car. To run the code, you can look at the HowToRunMain.txt function.
