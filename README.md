The given code is from the IV-DQN repository: https://github.com/montrealrobotics/iv_rl

I adapted the function calls from the different files and folders since I had problems running them. I also added the max_steps parameter, which represents the number of steps per episode.

To run the code, you can look at the HowToRunMain.txt function.
